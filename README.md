# Towards Next-Generation Recommender Systems: A Benchmark for Personalized Recommendation Assistant with LLMs
<!-- [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-id-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/id) -->

This repository contains the benchmark for the paper ["<u>Towards Next-Generation Recommender Systems: A Benchmark for Personalized Recommendation Assistant with LLMs</u>"].

**RecBench+** is the first public datasets that can be effectively used to evaluate the performance
of personalized recommendation assistants in the era of LLMs. The dataset comprises approximately 30,000 queries, spanning the domains of movie and book, constructed from movielens-1m and Amazon-Book, respectively. It is organized into 2 main categories and 5 subcategories. Below is the statistics of our benchmark.

<!-- ## Data Example
For each category, we provide an example to illustrate how the dataset can be used.

### Condition-based Query
#### Explicit Condition Query

<pre>
<code class="language-json">
{
        "source_user": "2326", // From which user's interaction history is this data extracted
        "condition_num": 2, // the number of conditions in this query, equals to the length of 'SharedRelationships'
        "movieCount": 2, // the number of movies that satisfy these conditions in user "2326" 's interaction history
        "movieSubset": [ // movies that satisfy these conditions in user "2326" 's interaction history
            "Forrest Gump (1994)",
            "Saving Private Ryan (1998)"
        ],
        "movieSubsetId": [ // movie ids
            356,
            2028
        ],
        "sharedRelationships": [ // serve as conditions
            [
                "Starring",
                "Tom Hanks"
            ],
            [
                "Genre",
                "War"
            ]
        ],
        "direct_description_query": "Can you recommend some war movies starring Tom Hanks?", // query generated by directly descripting conditions
        "situational_description_query": "I'm looking for a gripping film set in a war context, especially with Tom Hanks in the lead role. I love his ability to convey deep emotions, and I think a war setting would add an intense layer to his performance. Any suggestions would be great!", //query with more context, which we used in experiments
        "data_idx": 3862 // id of this data
    }
