{"id": "2374", "response": "Unfortunately, I can't find any books written by Matthew Armstrong related to the world of Narnia. However, if you are interested in books that capture the essence of Narnia's enchanting and immersive world, you might want to consider reading works by C.S. Lewis, the original author of The Chronicles of Narnia series. Here are some suggestions beyond Narnia that might also align with your interests in imaginary places:\n\n- \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" by C.S. Lewis\n- \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" by C.S. Lewis\n- \"The Magician's Nephew\" by C.S. Lewis\n\nIf there are any specific works by Matthew Armstrong related to Narnia in the future, they would likely be found by keeping an eye on new releases or fan fiction inspired by Lewis's works."}
