If you're interested in more books by Marian Cockrell, she primarily wrote scripts and there's limited additional published fiction work by her. However, if you're interested in similar story themes, I can suggest other children's literature with immersive storytelling and relatable themes. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed!"}
