{"id": "3235", "response": "Horst Janson is primarily known for his work in German cinema, and he did not appear in \"The Swan\" or \"The Country Girl.\" It seems there might be some confusion regarding the actor's film appearances or potential cross-referencing other films featuring similar themes or styles. Given this context and typical data I use, accurate recommendations are challenging. However, based on your enjoyed themes and historical enjoyment, consider:\n\n- \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969)\" (Cinematography by Michael Reed, but often stylistically similar sweeping visuals)\n- \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947)\" (Cinematography by Charles Lang who worked with similar dueling themes)\n- \"Rear Window (1954)\" (Cinematography by Robert Burks, though no Horst Janson involvement \u2013 it showcases Burks' style deeply)\n\nFor more targeted actor appreciation, you may explore performing arts databases or further refocus the direction of movie inquiries."}
