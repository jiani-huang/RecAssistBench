After research, it appears that Keeling did not write any fiction books. His notable works include \"Words of Science: And the History Behind Them,\" \"The Language of Science,\" and \"The Story of Science.\" If you are open to similar non-fiction science-themed books by other authors, I can provide alternative recommendations. Let me know!"}
{"id": "2253", "response": "Govindas Vishnoodas Desani is best known for his novel *All About H. Hatterr*, which, while not directly focused on mental illness, is a unique and experimental work that explores identity, philosophy, and existential themes. [SEP] Unfortunately, Desani did not write extensively on the subject of mental illness, so there are no other works by him that specifically delve into this topic as *Being Mentally ILL a Sociological Theory* does. You might consider exploring other authors or sociological works for further reading on mental illness."}
