However, if you are referring to the classic film \"Modern Times\" (1936) starring Charlie Chaplin, which was indeed known for its exceptional cinematography by Roland Totheroh, I can recommend other films from that era with great cinematography and performances. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. City Lights (1931) - Starring Charlie Chaplin, cinematography by Roland Totheroh.\n2. The Gold Rush (1925) - Starring Charlie Chaplin, cinematography by Roland Totheroh.\n3. The Great Dictator (1940) - Starring Charlie Chaplin, cinematography by Karl Struss and Roland Totheroh.\n4. Limelight (1952) - Starring Charlie Chaplin, cinematography by Karl Struss. [SEP] If you are looking for other films with exceptional cinematography from the same era, consider:\n1. Metropolis (1927) - Starring Brigitte Helm, cinematography by Karl Freund and Günther Rittau.\n2. Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927) - Starring George O'Brien and Janet Gaynor, cinematography by Charles Rosher and Karl Struss.\n3. The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) - Starring Maria Falconetti, cinematography by Rudolph Maté.\n4. The General (1926) - Starring Buster Keaton, cinematography by Bert Haines and Devereaux Jennings."}
