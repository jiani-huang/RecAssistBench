{"id": "3273", "response": "Unfortunately, specific writers from Penthouse Adult Magazine issues like October 1990 or September 1999 are not typically documented or easily identifiable, as the magazine features multiple contributors and genres. However, if you enjoyed the writing style and themes related to performing arts, you might explore works by authors who specialize in blending eroticism, drama, and artistic expression. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. *Henry Miller* - **\"Tropic of Cancer\"**[SEP]2. *Anaïs Nin* - **\"Delta of Venus\"**[SEP]3. *D.H. Lawrence* - **\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\"**[SEP]4. *Erica Jong* - **\"Fear of Flying\"**[SEP]5. *Jean Genet* - **\"Our Lady of the Flowers\"**[SEP]6. *Arthur Koestler* - **\"The Act of Creation\"** (exploring creativity and performing arts)[SEP]7. *Colette* - **\"Claudine\"** series (blending sensuality and theatrical life)[SEP]8. *Yukio Mishima* - **\"Confessions of a Mask\"** (exploring art, identity, and desire)[SEP]9. *Dorothy Allison* - **\"Bastard Out of Carolina\"** (raw storytelling with artistic undertones)[SEP]10. *Sarah Waters* - **\"Fingersmith\"** (melding intrigue, sensuality, and performance)\n\nIf you're looking for more explicit or niche works, exploring other literary erotica or performing arts-focused anthologies might also yield results."}
