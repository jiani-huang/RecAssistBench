{"id": "97-4", "response": "The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is indeed a timeless classic! Based on your interest in strong characters and philosophical depth, I recommend the following novels that explore individualism and moral philosophy:\n\n1. The Stranger by Albert Camus - A classic novel that explores alienation, morality, and the absurdity of life, all through the eyes of a complex and intriguing protagonist.\n2. Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky - A psychological masterpiece that delves into the mind of a young man who grapples with morality, guilt, and redemption, raising questions about the nature of right and wrong.\n3. The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde - A philosophical and psychological exploration of vanity, morality, and the human condition, as a young man's pursuit of beauty and youth leads him down a path of destruction.\n4. The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky - A rich and complex novel that explores the complexities of human nature, morality, and faith, as three brothers grapple with their own identities and the meaning of life.\n\nThese novels all share some of the same themes and elements that made Monte Cristo so compelling, and are sure to provide you with plenty of food for thought!"}
