However, I need to clarify that Mavis Staples didn't appear in \"What's Up, Tiger Lily?\" or \"What's New, Pussycat\". Both movies are from the 1960s, and Mavis Staples' film career started much later.\n\nThat being said, here are some movies that feature Mavis Staples:\n\n1. The Last Waltz (1978) - a documentary film about The Band's final concert, where Mavis Staples performs with The Staple Singers.\n2. Stop! Look! And Laugh! (1960) - a comedy film featuring The Staple Singers, including Mavis Staples.\n3. Wattstax (1973) - a documentary film showcasing the Wattstax music festival, where Mavis Staples and The Staple Singers perform.\n\nAs for movies featuring both Mavis Staples and Christopher Walken, I couldn't find any. However, I can suggest some movies featuring Christopher Walken that you might enjoy:\n\n1. The Deer Hunter (1978)\n2. Apocalypse Now (1979)\n3. True Romance (1993)\n\nPlease note that these movies may not feature Mavis Staples, but they are notable films starring Christopher Walken.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I apologize again for the initial confusion."}
