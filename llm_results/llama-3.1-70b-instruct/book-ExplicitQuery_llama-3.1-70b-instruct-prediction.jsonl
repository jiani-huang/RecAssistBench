{"id": "4600", "response": "I'm afraid I have some disappointing news. Arnold Toynbee and D. C. Somervell were not fiction writers, but rather historians and scholars.\n\nArnold Toynbee is best known for his 12-volume work \"A Study of History\", a historical analysis of the rise and fall of civilizations. While it's a monumental work, it's not a novel or a work of fiction.\n\nD. C. Somervell, on the other hand, is known for his abridgments of Toynbee's \"A Study of History\", as well as his own historical works, such as \"English Thought in the Nineteenth Century\". Again, not fiction.\n\nIf you're looking for captivating fiction, I'd be happy to recommend some novels or stories by other authors. Please let me know what type of fiction you're interested in (e.g. historical fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, mystery, etc.)!"}
