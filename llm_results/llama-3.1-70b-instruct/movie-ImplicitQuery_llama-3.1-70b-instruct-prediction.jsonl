{"id": "2107", "response": "While John Q (2002) and Mississippi Masala (1991) are quite different films, both starring Denzel Washington and Roshan Seth, respectively, I'll focus on recommending movies featuring these actors. Additionally, since pop rock isn't a traditional film genre, I'll suggest movies that incorporate pop rock music or have a similar tone. Here are some movie recommendations:\n\n[SEP] Philadelphia (1993) - Denzel Washington stars in this drama, which features a mix of genres, including a memorable soundtrack.\n\n[SEP] The Great Debaters (2007) - Denzel Washington directs and stars in this drama, which has a strong focus on music and performance.\n\n[SEP] Mr. Holland's Opus (1995) - While not strictly a pop rock film, this drama features a strong musical component, with Richard Dreyfuss starring as a music teacher.\n\n[SEP] What's Love Got to Do with It (1993) - Angela Bassett stars as Tina Turner in this biographical drama, which features a range of musical genres, including pop rock.\n\n[SEP] Candyman (1992) - Roshan Seth has a supporting role in this horror classic, which has a haunting soundtrack that incorporates elements of pop rock.\n\n[SEP] Mississippi Burning (1988) - Roshan Seth appears in this drama, which features a mix of genres and a memorable soundtrack.\n\nNote that these recommendations are based on the actors and genres you mentioned, but may not all be exact matches. I hope you find something that interests you!"}

Unfortunately, Bela Lugosi passed away in 1956, so he couldn't have appeared in The Haunted Palace.\n\nHowever, I can try to find some common ground. Here are some movie recommendations that feature either Vincent Price or Bob Hope, along with another classic horror or comedy star:\n\n[SEP] The Comedy of Terrors (1964) - This horror comedy features Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, and Peter Lorre.\n[SEP] Son of Paleface (1952) - This Western comedy stars Bob Hope, Jane Russell, and Roy Rogers, and features a horror-comedy tone.\n[SEP] The Raven (1963) - This horror comedy features Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, and Peter Lorre, with a similar atmosphere to The Haunted Palace.\n[SEP] Where There's Life (1947) - This comedy film stars Bob Hope and features a lighthearted tone similar to My Favorite Brunette.\n\nPlease note that these recommendations might not exactly match your request, but they feature similar actors and tones to the original movies."}
