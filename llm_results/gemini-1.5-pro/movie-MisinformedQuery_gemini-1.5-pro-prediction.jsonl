Antonio Calvache is not credited as the cinematographer for either *Evil Dead II* or *Mulholland Drive*. *Evil Dead II* was shot by Peter Deming, and *Mulholland Drive* was shot by Peter Deming (uncredited) and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Elmes.  Therefore, I cannot recommend other films \"with cinematography by Antonio Calvache.\"  It's possible you're thinking of a different cinematographer, or there's some confusion.  Perhaps you enjoyed the *style* of cinematography in those films, and are looking for something similar. If you can clarify what aspects of the visuals you liked (e.g., lighting, camera movement, composition), I can offer better recommendations.\n"}

{"id": "1454", "response": "You've got the actress Heather Burns confused with two other actresses.  Heather Burns (born 1975) has been in *Miss Congeniality*, *Two Weeks Notice*, and *You've Got Mail*.  There's no record of her being in *H.M.S. Defiant* or *The Bourne Identity*.\n\nThe 1962 film *H.M.S. Defiant* (also known as *Damn the Defiant!*), stars Alec Guinness and Dirk Bogarde.  It does not feature a credited actress named Heather Burns.\n\nThe 1988 TV Movie *The Bourne Identity* starred Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith.  It does not list an actress named Heather Burns in the credits.\n\nIt is possible you're thinking of two different actresses. If you can provide other information about the roles played by the actress you're thinking of (like the character name) or other films they've been in, I may be able to give you a more accurate recommendation.\n"}

While Peter Graves did act in several films, he wasn't actually in The Preacher's Wife (1996) or Renaissance Man (1994).  The actor you may be thinking of is Courtney B. Vance, who played the Reverend Henry Biggs in The Preacher's Wife.  Peter Graves is known for his roles in Mission: Impossible and Airplane!, but unfortunately, he wasn't primarily known for musical roles.\n\nIf you enjoyed Courtney B. Vance's performance in The Preacher's Wife, and are looking for other musicals he's been in, you could check out Hamburger Hill (1987). While not strictly a musical, it does feature musical elements and Vance's powerful performance.  Since he has primarily acted in dramatic roles, finding musicals with him might be difficult.\n\nIf you enjoyed the musical aspects of The Preacher's Wife,  here are some other gospel music-infused films you might appreciate:\n\nSister Act (1992)\nSister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993)\nThe Gospel (2005)\nJoyful Noise (2012)\n\n\nIf you reconsider and want recommendations based on Peter Graves' known filmography, please let me know.\n"}

Those films star other actors and are not thrillers or mysteries in the traditional sense. Alan King is primarily known for his comedic roles, not thrillers or mysteries.  Therefore, I can't recommend movies starring him in those genres.  You might be misremembering the actor or the films.

While he's credited in \"Fay Grim (2006),\" which has some stylized elements, it isn't generally classified as sci-fi.

Therefore, finding movies with both Hwang Shin-hye and Lance Henriksen is highly improbable, as they work in different film industries and have never collaborated.\n\nIf you're interested in films starring Robin Wright, you could consider movies like The Princess Bride, Forrest Gump, House of Cards (TV series), or Blade Runner 2049.\n\nFor films starring Lance Henriksen, consider Aliens, The Terminator, Near Dark, or Pumpkinhead.\n\nIf you meant Hwang Shin-hye, some of her notable works are  A Wish Upon a Star (TV series), The Legend (TV series), and Scandal: A Shocking and Wrongful Incident.  However, it's very unlikely she has appeared in any films with Lance Henriksen.\n"}
