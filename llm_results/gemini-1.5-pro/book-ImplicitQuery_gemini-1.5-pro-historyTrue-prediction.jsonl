{"id": "21", "response": "Since the query mentions \"other books by the same author\", and no author is explicitly mentioned,  it seems the user is intending to refer to the author of *Out on the Cutting Edge* and *Telling Lies for Fun and Profit*.  Unfortunately, with only these two titles (which I can't find matching known books), I can't definitively determine the author.  Therefore, I can't provide recommendations from that author.\n\nIf the user can clarify the author's name or provide more details about those books (e.g., genre, themes), I can offer more tailored recommendations.  Alternatively, based on the user's provided reading history, which includes thrillers, hard-boiled detective fiction, and some suspense, I could recommend authors like:\n\n* **Jim Thompson:**  Similar gritty and dark themes to *The Killer Inside Me*.\n* **John D. MacDonald:** If they enjoyed *The Deep Blue Goodbye*, more of Travis McGee's adventures would likely be appealing.\n* **Lee Child:** Since they've read *Persuader*, other Jack Reacher novels are a safe bet.\n* **Elmore Leonard:**  Known for sharp dialogue and compelling plots, much like *Out of Sight*.\n* **Mickey Spillane:**  In the same vein as *I, the Jury*, with tough-talking detectives and fast-paced action.\n\n\nHowever, these are general recommendations based on the user's past reads and not specifically tied to the author of the two books mentioned in the query.\n"}

{"id": "612", "response": "There is no author associated with both \"Murder in the CIA\" and \"First Ladies: An Intimate Group Portrait of White House Wives\".  \"Murder in the CIA\" appears to be a fictional work (and might be confused with non-fiction books about CIA assassinations), while \"First Ladies\" is a non-fiction work typically authored by historians or journalists.  Therefore, there's no single author to recommend.\n\nHowever, if you enjoyed the political intrigue and suspense of \"Murder in the CIA\", I could recommend books by authors like Brad Thor, Vince Flynn, or Daniel Silva.\n\nIf the historical aspect and insight into the lives of the First Ladies in \"First Ladies\" was more appealing, I might recommend other books about First Ladies, such as \"The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House\" by Kate Andersen Brower or biographies of specific First Ladies like \"Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: A Life Beyond Her Wildest Dreams\" by Donald Spoto.\n"}

Naipaul: A novel set in post-colonial East Africa that examines themes of identity and displacement.\n* **Things Fall Apart** by Chinua Achebe: A classic novel about the clash between traditional Igbo culture and British colonialism in Nigeria.\n\n\nThese suggestions cover a range of genres, from historical accounts and travel narratives to fiction, all with a focus on Africa.

{"id": "2045", "response": "Unfortunately, dictionaries are often compiled by teams of lexicographers and editors rather than a single author.  Kodansha's dictionaries, while published by Kodansha, don't list a single author in the traditional sense.  Therefore, finding other books by the \"same person\" isn't possible in this context.\n\nHowever, if your goal is to enhance your Japanese language learning, I can suggest some resources similar in purpose to the *Furigana English-Japanese Dictionary*:\n\n* **Kodansha's Kanji Learner's Dictionary:**  This dictionary focuses on kanji, providing detailed information on meanings, readings, stroke order, and common compounds.\n* **A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar:**  A great resource for understanding Japanese sentence structure and grammar rules.\n* **Essential Japanese Grammar:** Another highly regarded grammar guide for learners of Japanese.\n* **Remembering the Kanji 1 by James Heisig:**  This book presents a systematic approach to learning kanji characters.\n* **Genki I & II:** These textbooks are popular choices for beginners and cover essential vocabulary, grammar, and conversational skills.\n\n\nIf you're interested in reading more Japanese literature (given your reading history), I can also recommend some authors and works based on your previous choices:\n\n\n* **More by Natsume Soseki:**  Since you've read *And Then*, explore his other works like *Kokoro*, *Botchan*, or *I Am a Cat*.\n* **Other Japanese authors translated into English:**  Look into authors like Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa,  Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki, or Yasunari Kawabata.\n* **Modern Japanese fiction:**  Explore contemporary Japanese novels and short stories available in English translation.  Check out bookshops or online resources specializing in Japanese literature.\n\n\nI understand your initial request wasn't exactly answerable, but I hope these alternative suggestions are helpful for your Japanese language journey!\n"}

{"id": "2622", "response": "I was unable to find books by the author of \"Hitler Speaks\" (Hermann Rauschning).  It's worth noting that this book has been the subject of much debate regarding its authenticity and is now widely considered to be a forgery.\n\nIf you're interested in German political history surrounding the Nazi period, I can recommend some well-regarded and reliable alternatives:\n*The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich* by William L. Shirer [SEP] *Inside the Third Reich* by Albert Speer [SEP] *Mein Kampf* by Adolf Hitler (while important for understanding Nazi ideology, it's crucial to read this with a critical eye due to its propaganda and inaccuracies) [SEP] *The Coming of the Third Reich* by Richard J. Evans [SEP] *Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland* by Christopher R.

{"id": "2922", "response": "There is no author listed for 'Our Sun and the Worlds Around It: Planets, Moons, Comets, and Other Wonders of the Solar System'.  It appears to be an older, possibly public domain work, making identifying the author and other works by them difficult.  Therefore, I can't offer books by the *same* author. However, based on your interest in astronomy and the solar system, here are some recommendations for similar books about those topics:\n\n1. A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking:  A classic and accessible explanation of cosmology, black holes, and the universe.\n\n2. Cosmos by Carl Sagan:  Based on his popular TV series, Sagan explores the vastness of space and humanity's place within it.\n\n3. The Planets by Dava Sobel:  Offers engaging narratives about each planet in our solar system, blending scientific understanding with historical and cultural perspectives.\n\n4. Astrophysics for People in a Hurry by Neil deGrasse Tyson:  A concise and witty guide to the universe, covering topics from planets and stars to galaxies and black holes.\n\n5. Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space by Carl Sagan: A thought-provoking sequel to Cosmos, examining humanity's potential for exploration and settlement beyond Earth.\n\n6.  NightWatch: A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe by Terence Dickinson: If you are interested in actually *observing* the night sky, this is a classic beginner guide to amateur astronomy and using telescopes.\n\n\n"}

Therefore, I can't directly fulfill your request for additional books specifically by the author of \"Language and Human Behavior (Jessie and John Danz Lectures).\"\n\nTo offer some alternative recommendations, since you enjoyed the social science aspects, perhaps you would be interested in books with related themes:\n\n* **Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert B. Cialdini:** Explores the psychology behind why people say yes and how to apply these understandings ethically in various settings.\n* **Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman:**  A Nobel laureate's exploration of the two systems that drive the way we think and make decisions.\n* **Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely:**  Delves into the hidden forces that shape our decisions, revealing how we are not as rational as we believe.\n* **The Social Animal by Elliot Aronson:** A classic text exploring the complexities of social interaction, covering topics like conformity, persuasion, and aggression.\n* **Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain:**  Examines the power and potential of introversion in a society that often prioritizes extroversion.\n\n\nThese recommendations touch on similar themes of human behavior, decision-making, and social dynamics that you might appreciate.  If you could provide more information about what specifically interested you in \"Language and Human Behavior,\" I might be able to tailor more relevant suggestions.
